# local-surf-report
An aggregation of surf information from NOAA and other sources for personal use

Currently this is being implemented as a single static page, however due to NOAA not having CORS support, this is likely to require a server (or at the very least be dependent on a proxy).

Current proxy info:
- https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/
- https://stackoverflow.com/a/43881141

Some potential sources of data:
- Waimea Buoy: https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=51201
- Barber's Point Buoy: https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=51212
